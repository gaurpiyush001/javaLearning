Important Points
1.)In Java, only classes or methods can be declared as abstract, we can not declare a variable as abstract.
2.)We use the keyword abstract to declare both class and method as abstract.
3.)If we declare any method as abstract, the class automatically needs to become an abstract class.
4.)An abstract class can have a constructor.
